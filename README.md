# Ferris_Wheel_Css
Explanation
The HTML structure creates a container for the Ferris wheel with the class ferris-wheel. Inside it, there's a wheel div that represents the rotating part of the Ferris wheel.
Each cabin div represents a cabin on the Ferris wheel. The inline styles position the cabins at specific angles around the wheel.
The CSS positions the Ferris wheel in the center of the screen and applies a spinning animation to the wheel.
The @keyframes spin rule defines a continuous rotation from 0 to 360 degrees.
The animation properties in the .wheel class make the wheel rotate infinitely in a linear motion over 10 seconds.
By combining this HTML and CSS, you get a rotating Ferris wheel animation with cabins positioned evenly around the wheel.
